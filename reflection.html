            <h3>Here are some insights from my PCK:</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>I find that I tend to be more individualistic prioritzing important individual skill assets that align with my own interest
                rather than the group's interest. I also find that I tend to be more of a constructivist learner, I tend to learn more
                effectively when I am able to construct my own understanding of the topic rather than just memorizing the information.
                I also find that I tend to be more of a reflective learner, I tend to learn more effectively when I am able to reflect on
                my own learning and experiences. I also find that I tend to be more of a casual learner, I tend to learn more effectively
                when I am able to undestand the information. I also find that I tend to be more of a global learner, I tend to learn more
                effectively when I am best at arithmetic reasoning with several math skills that I can utilze from, I
                tend to to also be a good communicatior. Overall I find my PCK results to be fairly accurate although my interest more align with the field of Computer Science i would say Mathematics Generally relates to that.</p>
